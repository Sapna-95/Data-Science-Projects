## ‚úàÔ∏è Airlines

### Problem Statement:
Understanding factors that affect flight delays, customer satisfaction, and overall performance in the airline industry is critical for improving services and operational efficiency. This project aims to analyze large datasets from airlines to uncover patterns and provide actionable insights.

### Research Objectives:
- **Flight Delay Prediction**: Build a model to predict the likelihood of flight delays based on various factors such as weather, airline performance, and scheduling.
- **Customer Satisfaction Analysis**: Identify factors that influence customer satisfaction and determine strategies for improving service quality.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Investigate factors affecting flight operations, such as turnaround times, cancellations, and delays.

### Tools & Techniques:
- **SQL**: For querying large airline datasets.
- **Python**: For statistical analysis and building machine learning models.
- **Data Visualization**: To uncover trends and patterns in airline performance.

## üíº Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)

### Problem Statement:
The **Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)** is a foundational concept in finance used to describe the relationship between expected return and risk. This project involves developing a Python-based tool to calculate the expected return of a stock using CAPM.

### Research Objectives:
- **CAPM Formula**: Implement the CAPM formula: 
  \[
  r_i = r_f + B_i(r_m - r_f)
  \]
  Where:
  - \(r_i\) is the expected return on the security.
  - \(r_f\) is the risk-free rate of return.
  - \(B_i\) is the beta of the stock relative to the market.
  - \(r_m\) is the expected return of the market.
  
- **Risk and Return Analysis**: Analyze the relationship between risk and return for a variety of stocks.

### Tools & Techniques:
- **Python**: For CAPM calculations and stock data analysis.
- **SQL**: For querying historical stock data.
- **Data Visualization**: To visualize the risk-return tradeoff.

## üè® Hotel Booking

### Problem Statement:
With the growing competition in the hotel industry, understanding factors influencing bookings, cancellations, and customer satisfaction is crucial for improving business strategies. This project focuses on analyzing hotel booking data to derive meaningful insights.

### Research Objectives:
- **Booking Cancellations**: Analyze factors that lead to booking cancellations, including seasonality, customer types, and booking channels.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Identify different types of customers and their preferences based on booking data.
- **Revenue Management**: Develop strategies for maximizing revenue based on room availability and booking trends.

### Tools & Techniques:
- **SQL**: For querying hotel booking data.
- **Python**: For statistical analysis and customer segmentation.
- **Data Visualization**: To identify booking patterns and trends.

## üçΩÔ∏è Restaurant Success Analysis Using Yelp Dataset

### Problem Statement:
In the competitive restaurant industry, understanding the factors that contribute to business success is vital. This project investigates the relationship between **user engagement** (reviews, tips, and check-ins) and **business success metrics** (review count and ratings) for restaurants using the **Yelp dataset**.

### Research Objectives:
- **User Engagement Analysis**: Quantify the correlation between user engagement (reviews, tips, check-ins) and success metrics such as review count and star ratings.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Investigate the impact of sentiment in reviews and tips on star ratings and review count.
- **Time Trends**: Explore if consistent user engagement over time leads to long-term success for restaurants.

### Tools & Techniques:
- **Python**: For sentiment analysis, data processing, and statistical modeling.
- **SQL**: For managing large Yelp datasets.
- **Data Visualization**: To visualize user engagement trends and correlations with success metrics.
