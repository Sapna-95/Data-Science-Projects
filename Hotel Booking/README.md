# 🏨 Hotel Booking Cancellation Analysis

## 📄 Project Overview

In recent years, both City Hotel and Resort Hotel have experienced high cancellation rates, negatively impacting revenue and room utilization. This report focuses on analyzing hotel booking cancellations, identifying key factors that contribute to these cancellations, and providing data-driven business recommendations to help mitigate the issue and increase efficiency.

## ❓ Research Question

1. **What are the variables that affect hotel reservation cancellations?**

## 📊 Hypotheses

1. **💵 Higher Prices Lead to More Cancellations:** Customers are more likely to cancel their reservations when prices are high.
2. **⏳ Longer Waiting Lists Increase Cancellations:** A longer waiting period tends to drive customers to cancel.
3. **🛎️ Offline Travel Agents Play a Major Role:** A majority of clients book their reservations through offline travel agents.

## 🔍 Analysis and Findings

The accompanying bar graph shows the percentage of reservations that were canceled and those that were not. It's clear that while a significant portion of reservations were retained, **37% of all bookings were canceled**, which greatly impacts the hotel's earnings.

- **🏙️ City Hotels**: Higher number of bookings, potentially due to lower prices compared to resort hotels.
- **🏖️ Resort Hotels**: Fewer bookings, likely due to higher pricing.

### 📈 Variables Impacting Cancellations:

1. **💸 Pricing**: Higher room rates seem to correlate with increased cancellations, especially in Resort Hotels.
2. **🌐 Customer Demographics**: The majority of reservations are made through offline travel agents, possibly influencing the cancellation rate due to less transparent or complex booking processes.
3. **🕒 Lead Time**: Longer waiting times or a longer lead time between booking and stay may result in a higher likelihood of cancellation.

## 💡 Recommendations

### 1. Reducing Cancellation Rates:

- **📆 Flexible Booking Policies**: Introduce more flexible cancellation or rescheduling policies, especially for long-lead bookings.
- **📉 Dynamic Pricing**: Offer discounts or incentives for early bookings and reduce the price difference between City and Resort hotels to maintain competitiveness.
- **🔔 Transparency**: Improve communication with customers booking through travel agents by providing detailed cancellation policies and reminders.

### 2. Improving Pricing & Promotion Strategies:

- **📊 Demand-Based Pricing**: Implement a dynamic pricing strategy based on demand patterns to adjust prices in real-time and encourage bookings during low-demand periods.
- **🎯 Seasonal Promotions**: Offer targeted promotions and packages during off-peak seasons, especially for Resort Hotels.
- **🎁 Loyalty Programs**: Introduce or enhance loyalty programs that reward guests who book directly with the hotel or book multiple stays, reducing dependency on travel agents and lowering cancellation rates.
