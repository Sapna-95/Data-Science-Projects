# Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) 📈

This project demonstrates how to implement the **Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)** using **Python** for financial analysis and **SQL** for data management. CAPM is a model used to determine the expected return on an asset based on its risk compared to the market.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The project calculates returns based on key financial data, such as:
- **Risk-Free Asset Return**: Derived from assets like U.S. Treasury bills.
- **Market Portfolio Return**: Typically modeled using data from indices such as the S&P 500.
- **CAPM Formula**: To calculate the expected return of a security using the following equation:
  
  \[
  r_i = r_f + B_i (r_m - r_f)
  \]

Where:
- \( r_i \): Expected return on a security.
- \( r_f \): Risk-free return rate.
- \( B_i \): Beta (volatility relative to the market).
- \( r_m \): Expected market return.

## 📂 Project Structure

- **SQL**: Used for storing and managing financial data (historical bond yields, market returns, etc.).
- **Python**: Handles calculations and visualizations, including CAPM calculations.
  
## 🔧 Installation

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/capital-asset-pricing-model.git
    cd capital-asset-pricing-model
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Set up your database**:
   Import financial data into your SQL database and configure the connection in the `config.py` file.

4. **Run the CAPM analysis**:
    ```bash
    python capm.py
    ```

## 🗂️ Features

1. **Risk-Free Return Calculation**: Calculate the return on risk-free assets.
2. **Market Return Calculation**: Calculate market returns using SQL queries.
3. **CAPM Calculation**: Calculate the expected return of an asset using Python.
4. **Data Visualization**: Generate graphs and visualizations of risk and return.

## 🖼️ Example Output
